<h3>1. <strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Path of Terraria</p>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> ARPG Mod for Terraria</p>
<p><strong>Engine:</strong> Terraria (tModLoader)</p>
<p><strong>Inspired by:</strong> Path of Exile 1 &amp; 2, Last Epoch, Diablo, Torchlight</p>
<p><strong>Core Concept:</strong> Transform Terraria into an ARPG experience with deep skill trees, loot systems, towns, quests, and curated boss encounters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following statements are core concepts and ideas for the mod.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are not here to recreate Path of Exile within the Terraria Universe</li>
  <li>We are not tied to a single ARPG or game. We are curating the best of all worlds into the Terraria game.</li>
  <li>We intend to keep the exploration from Terraria, mixing in areas that feel appropriate</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. <strong>Game Vision &amp; Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Offer a fresh ARPG experience within Terraria’s world and mechanics.</p>
<p>Provide extensive customization through skill trees and augmentations.</p>
<p>Replace traditional boss fights with curated, instance-based “Boss Domains.”</p>
<p>Introduce towns and quests to guide progression and narrative.</p>
<p>Implement systems encouraging build diversity and replayability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. <strong>Core Gameplay Mechanics</strong></h3>
<h4>Passive Tree System</h4>
<p>Large interconnected web of nodes.</p>
<p>Focus on attributes, damage types, skill scaling, and utility.</p>
<p>Encourages unique character builds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Active Skills &amp; Specializations</h4>
<p>Active skills are items or abilities the player uses.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Major node selections altering skill functionality (e.g., Nova → Frost Nova).</p>
<p>One specialization per skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Skill Augmentations</h4>
<p>Applied using <strong>Augmentation Orbs</strong> (global drop).</p>
<p>Unlocks slots on skills for augments.</p>
<p>By default: 2 augment slots, with possible progression to increase.</p>
<p>Augments resemble support skill gems from Path of Exile</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Towns &amp; Quests</h4>
<p>Towns will be the central point for getting quests, with options in the future of having additional areas of getting quests such as the overworld-built Tavern.</p>
<p>In a future state there will be multiple towns across progression stages.</p>
<p>Quests guide players through narrative and unlocks.</p>
<p>Hub NPCs include merchants, quest givers, crafting stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Boss Domains</h4>
<p>Boss domains replace classic Terraria boss fights with curated boss encounters. Bosses are more linear than vanilla Terraria. The previous boss must be downed before continuing onto the next boss. Curated instance maps with set arenas, themed enemies, traps, and the boss encounter.</p>
<p>Opened through a Map<strong> </strong>Device.</p>

<h3>4. <strong>Progression Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Character levels unlock passive points which can be spent on the passive tree to further advance your character.</p>
<p>Gear scaling follows ARPG itemization (rarities, affixes). Affixes tiers get better the deeper into <a href="/Mechanics/AreaLevel">area level</a> you go and the roll ranges of said affixes get higher.</p>
<p>Towns and quests unlock new gameplay systems, areas, and bosses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Combat &amp; Builds</strong></h3>
<p>Builds driven by skill choices, and passives.</p>
<p>Supports melee, ranged, summoning, magic, and hybrid builds.</p>
<p>Each skill can feel and function differently based on the player’s skill passives and augmentations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. <strong>Loot &amp; Economy</strong></h3>
<p>Global loot drop system (influenced by ARPGs).</p>
<p>Currency items like Augmentation Orbs can be used to further craft your gear.</p>
<p>Gear with affix-based stats, sockets (future), and rarity tiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. <strong>World Design</strong></h3>
<p>Terraria world still explored, but towns and domains redefine zones.</p>
<p>Procedural and curated elements mixed.</p>
<p>Boss Domains are self-contained challenge maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. <strong>User Interface</strong></h3>
<p>Reworked UI for skill tree, quests, and augment management.</p>
<p>Map device interface for traveling to boss domains and explorable maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. <strong>Multiplayer Support</strong></h3>
<p>Full compatibility with Terraria multiplayer.</p>
<p>Sync quests, domains, and drops.</p>
