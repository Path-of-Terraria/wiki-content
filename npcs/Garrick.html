<p>Garrick is a fellow adventurer, beaten up and sorry looking after a recent bout with the King Slime.</p>
<p>Garrick &nbsp;wears a suit of slightly dented but well-maintained armor, showing signs of previous battles. His broad shoulders are draped with a tattered red cape. Garrick’s face contains messy brown hair and a trimmed beard.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Garrick will appear in <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest</a>'s tavern after completing your first <a href="/Quests/ClassQuests">class quest.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Boss Domain Quest - King Slime</h3>
<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Garrick</p>
<p>He lets you know that he failed to defeat the King Slime recently but was able to draw map to navigate to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/King_Slime">King Slime</a> and take him down. He hands you a King Slime Map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing the map on a Map Device creates a portal, sending you directly to the King Slime's domain.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Kill the King Slime<br><strong>Next:</strong> Talk to Garrick</p>
<p>Garrick thanks you, promising that you won't outperform him again. The quest ends here.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p><i>“Watch your head. Generally good advice, but especially in the King's domain.”</i><br><i>"Forge your blade as powerful as you can. Cutting through slime is deceptively difficult."</i><br><i>“The ground shakes uncontrollably in the King's domain. As if slime seeps into the rock.”</i><br><i>“Adventurers often fail to tell you of how slimy adventuring is. I am not one of those adventurers. It's extremely slimy.”</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Kill the King’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“You may be able to tell - I've not had the best time. Tried to take down the King, almost lost everything. You are the one who restored Ravencrest, yes? Would I ask of you; slay the King Slime on my behalf? I'll reward you greatly. Take this map; I drew it on the long walk back. Good luck!”</i></p>
<p><strong>After slaying the King Slime:</strong><br><i>“I can hardly believe it. Well, you've succeeded where I failed, stranger. I best get back to it; you will not surpass me again. My thanks, however, are in order.”</i></p>
