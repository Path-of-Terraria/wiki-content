<p>Garrick is a fellow adventurer, beaten up and sorry looking after a recent bout with the King Slime.</p>
<p>Garrick &nbsp;wears a suit of slightly dented but well-maintained armor, showing signs of previous battles. His broad shoulders are draped with a tattered red cape. Garrickâ€™s face contains messy brown hair and a trimmed beard.</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Garrick will appear in <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest</a>'s tavern after completing your first <a href="/Quests/ClassQuests">class quest.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Boss Domain Quest - King Slime</h3>
<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Garrick</p>
<p>He lets you know that he failed to defeat the King Slime recently but was able to draw map to navigate to the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/King_Slime">King Slime</a> and take him down. He hands you a King Slime Map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing the map on a Map Device creates a portal, sending you directly to the King Slime's domain.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Kill the King Slime<br><strong>Next:</strong> Talk to Garrick</p>
<p>Garrick thanks you, promising that you won't outperform him again. The quest ends here.</p>
