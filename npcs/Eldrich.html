<h3>Eye of Cthulhu Domain - The Rising Omen</h3>
<p>Eldric notices the player's involvement with defeating King Slime and offers to share his concerns about the Eye of Cthulhu. This quest should only become available after the King Slime questline is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Starting</strong>: Speak to Eldric in the Desert.</p>
<p>Eldric speaks of strange occurrences—distorted starlight, whispers in the night, and the moon crying an unnatural red. He believes an ancient evil, the Eye of Cthulhu, is awakening.</p>
<p>Eldric sends the player to collect 5 <strong>Lunar Shards</strong>, rare fragments found on wandering enemies at night, symbolizing the growing power of the Eye. This provides a thematic reason for encountering foes and getting accustomed to night exploration.</p>
<p>Eldric mentions that the Lunar Shards can be used to create a liquid for a ritual that can take place during night to bring out the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></p>
<p>Lunar shards drop from <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Demon_Eye">Demon Eyes</a> , and <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Zombie">Zombies</a> during the night time. They have a 1 in 5 drop rate.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Bring the 5 Lunar Shards to <a href="/npcs/Garrick">Garrick</a></p>
<p>Garrick hands you a “Strange Liquid". He mentions that the liquid should be ready to be mixed with the lunar shards to summon the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Return to Eldric</p>
<p>Eldric mentions he is ready to make the liquid and start the ritual. At this point a confirmation is sent to the user with a warning that this will open a portal to the Eye of Cthulhu domain.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Travel to the Eye of Cthulhu Domain</p>
<p>Upon accepting the confirmation the ritual is performed. Visually you see swirling of stars above you which come crashing down on a location near you which forms a portal that can be entered to travel to the Eye of Cthulhu domain.</p>
