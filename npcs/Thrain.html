<h3>Class Quest - Forging a New Blade</h3>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: Talk to Thrain Ironfist</p>
<p>Thrain notes the state of the Iron Anvil as it's first found - completely destroyed. He slept through whatever happened. Either way, he would love some materials to help the repair process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He asks for you to retrieve the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20 Lead or Iron Ore</li>
  <li>1 Lead or Iron Hammer</li>
  <li>50 Stone</li>
  <li>20 Wood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Retrieve the materials and bring them to Thrain</p>
<p>He thanks you for your work, stating that the forge should be more repaired next time you come back. He hands you a blade he had made shortly before the attack as a test product, and asks you to test it on some Zombies. He also asks for a few more materials so the Iron Anvil can be ready to go as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He asks for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>30 Stone Blocks</li>
  <li>50 Wood</li>
  <li>10 Gold or Platinum Bars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Kill 15 Zombies<br><strong>Next</strong>: Return to Thrain with the materials</p>
<p>He graciously thanks you again for your work, confident the Iron Anvil will be ready to go by the time you return again. He then teaches you a powerful lesson about combat: â€œSometimes, you gotta go crazy." - netting you the Berserk skill. The quest ends here.</p>
