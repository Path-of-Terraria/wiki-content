<h3>Class Quest - Forging a New Blade</h3>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: Talk to Thrain Ironfist</p>
<p>Thrain notes the state of the Iron Anvil as it's first found - completely destroyed. He slept through whatever happened. Either way, he would love some materials to help the repair process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He asks for you to retrieve the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20 Lead or Iron Ore</li>
  <li>1 Lead or Iron Hammer</li>
  <li>50 Stone</li>
  <li>20 Wood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Retrieve the materials and bring them to Thrain</p>
<p>He thanks you for your work, stating that the forge should be more repaired next time you come back. He hands you a blade he had made shortly before the attack as a test product, and asks you to test it on some Zombies. He also asks for a few more materials so the Iron Anvil can be ready to go as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He asks for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>30 Stone Blocks</li>
  <li>50 Wood</li>
  <li>10 Gold or Platinum Bars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Kill 15 Zombies<br><strong>Next</strong>: Return to Thrain with the materials</p>
<p>He graciously thanks you again for your work, confident the Iron Anvil will be ready to go by the time you return again. He then teaches you a powerful lesson about combat: “Sometimes, you gotta go crazy." - netting you the Berserk skill. The quest ends here.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p><i>“Forged in steel, I am. Care to buy some?”</i><br><i>“Sometimes, I miss the caverns. Rock and stone, brother, rock and stone."</i><br><i>“Nothing quite like a blade that cuts through bone like air. Makes sandwiches easy!"</i><br><i>“I could easily beat you in an arm wrestle - the exercise of steel forging is effective.”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>'Forging a New Blade' Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br>“<i>As you can see, some terrible event happened that simply obliterated my forge. What happened? I don't know, I sleep like a rock…anyhow. I'd love some help gathering materials, the town's metal has run dry for a while now. And maybe some wood while you're at it.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After handing in first set of materials:</strong><br><i>“Fantastic! I'll fix the old forge up quick as I can. Here, take this sword. It's a test I made right before the attack. I'd like for you to test it on some zombies; those buggers are awful to deal with. If you'd be so kind, I'd also enjoy some more materials. Then I think we can get the Iron Anvil truly back to her feet!”</i></p>
<p><strong>After handing in second set of materials:</strong><br><i>“It almost brings a tear to the eye. The Iron Forge is almost ready for work! Here, this is a lesson I've got from my history in battle: Sometimes, you gotta go crazy. Just be careful! And come back whenever you wish - you've been a great help!”</i></p>
