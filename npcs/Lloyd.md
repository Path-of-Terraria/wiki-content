**Lloyd** is an adventurer with one goal. He is found in the aboveground Crimson after beating the Eye of Cthulhu domain.
He wears a clean but practical almost suit-like outfit, wings for mobility and has various magical touches about him.

### Location
After beating the Eye of Cthulhu's domain, Lloyd can be found on the surface of the Crimson. He is walking freely and will behave like a normal town NPC.

### Boss Domain Quest - A Heart Still Beating
**Starting:** Find and speak to Lloyd in the aboveground Crimson

Morven mentions he's got some specific reason to look into the Crimson's many hearts hidden deep underground. He asks you if you would be able to take him down there to smash them.

**Next:** Smash One Crimson Heart

Upon guiding Lloyd to the underground Crimson, and having him smash a heart, he will remark on how more must be sacrificed. He asks you to continue along and smash more.

Smashing another will have Lloyd tell you that you should be prepared. He can be asked to stay if you wish to gather materials or ready weapons.

**Next:** Enter the Brain of Cthulhu's Domain

Upon smashing the last heart, a large maw rips open the walls behind you and Lloyd and eat you whole. After a short wait, you will be transported to the domain of the Brain.

**Next:** Kill the Brain of Cthulhu

Your task upon entering is to kill the Brain. You may ask Lloyd for advice, and he will mention that he's using some sort of power to allow you additional mid-air jumps as the Brain's domain is treacherous and imposing.

**Next:** Talk to Lloyd in the overworld

After successfully defeating the Brain, you will both return to where you were eaten in the overworld. He will thank you graciously for the help, and note that he'll be going to Ravencrest. He does not need to be led there.

If you fail to kill the Brain and are kicked out, you will respawn in the overworld alongside Lloyd. He'll mention that it's a difficult beast to fight, and offer again to break a Crimson heart in order to rematch.

#### Rewards

- 7500 experience
- The Brain of Cthulhu boss domain map can now be dropped as a global item (1/1000)
- A rare accessory (Amulet or Ring)



### Dialogue
#### General Dialogue
*"I've little to say."
"Keep the world safe."
"Hm?"
"Hello, fellow adventurer."*
  
#### 'A Heart Still Beating' Quest
**Upon starting:**
*"Hm. Fellow aide. You seem to know the lay of the land. I'm here looking for the heart that yet beats. Would you be so kind as to guide me to it? I've matters to contend with. I'll fend monsters, you guide."*
 
**While following the player:**
*"Best we keep moving."
"I've but one goal for the moment."
"Keep a keen eye."
"Hmph."*

**When arriving in the Brain of Cthulhu domain:**
"Alas, I'm here once more. I know my strength can't overpower the Brain. I am using what I have to allow you three additional jumps. The pillars of the land tower above, and may be much too difficult to scale otherwise. Be well, and be swift. I will be ruminating."

**When spoken to in the domain:**
*"This land shakes any man."
"Please, for me, defeat the Brain. I cannot stand to be here any longer."
"May my boon help you greatly. I wish I could do more, but the pillars tower over my strength."
"Cut through the obstacles here. They were never truly living."*

**When failing the domain:**
*"You were felled too? Alas. A mighty beast, but not one without flaw. Guide me to another still-beating heart, and we return. Take caution."*

**After defeating the Brain of Cthulhu**
*"What a great joy. I owe you everything I have, which is not much. Take this. I shall be returning to Ravencrest - I've been before, no need to take me. Be well, and be merry."*
