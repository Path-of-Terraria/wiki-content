<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Rhine can be found relaxing in the tavern after beating the Eye of Cthulhu.</p>
<h3>Boss Domain Quest - Frigid Beast</h3>
<p><strong>Starting:</strong> Rhine tells of a tale her mother used to tell her as a child. A massive, lumbering creature called the Deerclops which hunts the tundra of a distant land.</p>
<p>She asks you to return with a certain curio, the Frozen Antler, from the underground ice biome. Rhine hands you a simple compass to find the area. If you lose the compass for some reason, you can return to Rhine and ask her to make another for 15 wood.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Search the ancient stronghold under the snow biome's surface.</p>
<p>With the compass, find and enter the ancient stronghold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After grabbing the Frozen Antler, an ancient item of unknown power, a large wraith that looks like a deer skull begins chasing you. It deals very high damage but is relatively simple to dodge in open air.</p>
<p>Once you exit to the surface, the apparition disappears and you may return to Ravencrest to talk to Rhine.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Talk to Rhine and give her the Frozen Antler</p>
<p>Rhine remarks on how she's heard so much about an ancient antler horn just like this one. She's dumbfounded. After a moment of absolute astonishment, she says to ask Elara (the Hunter) about the Deerclops's location, and comments on what her mother must think seeing the antlers again.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Talk to Elara and ask about the Deerclops</p>
<p>Elara says she wouldn't go herself, but she does know the location to the Deerclop's habitat. She draws up a quick map for you to follow to the domain for use on a Map Device. She warns of the dark in the area, and to be calm.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Enter the Domain and kill the Deerclops<br><strong>Next: </strong>Return to Ravencrest and talk to Rhine</p>
<p>Rhine is speechless. She simply says thank you, to be well, and she hopes your strength can help the people of Ravencrest. The quest is finished.</p>
<p>If you do not successfully kill the Deerclops, you can return to Elara, who, for a small fee of 20 gold coins, will draw you another map.</p>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p><i>“Ah! Nothing like a day in Ravencrest for some world-famous mead.”</i><br><i>"Say, you do any travelling? Have you ever seen a "cow area"? My family spoke of legends."</i><br><i>“Five gold coins and I can tell you the most wild story you've ever heard. Up for it?”</i><br><i>"Good heavens, this tastes like nothing else. You also taking an off day?"</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Frigid Beast’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“Ah, adventurer. You have any experience with the deep tundra? I've always been curious of a story my mother told me...about one massive, lumbering beast deep in a frigid tundra. She spoke of it as legend, and I've always been curious. Alas, I don't handle the cold well; but perhaps you do? I've high interest, though I'm not sure if it's even real. There's a small fortress in the world's snow, a short distance under the surface. Take this compass, find it, and open it. You'll know what to take.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After delivering Strange Antlers:</strong><br><i>“Wow...sorry. I...I genuinely didn't think these were real. My mother spoke of these, a simple set of four-point antlers with a discoloration near the points. Odd aura. Strangely uncomfortable to hold. Wow. Well. I suppose you should seek the Deer itself, then. The Hunter can tell you about it - she knows all creatures that stalk the woods, white or not. I'll be here, I can only imagine what my mother will think seeing these antlers again.”</i></p>
<p><strong>When talking to Rhine without the compass:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>Did you lose your compass? Give me 15 wood and I can sharpen one up for you.”</i><br><i>“Here's another one for you. You're lucky I can carve wood anywhere always. Go get them!...if you can find them.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After defeating Deerclops:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>...unbelievable. Truly...I don't know what to say. Take this. I'll be here, stewing in revelation. Go have fun. Brom, another mead, please. Unbelievable...”</i></p>
