<h3>Class Quest - Drawing the Bow</h3>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Elara</p>
<p>Elara notes the destruction after a recent attack, and asks for your help in gathering materials to repair while she checks what was and wasn't destroyed. She asks you bring her the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20 Silk</li>
  <li>50 Wood</li>
  <li>50 Stone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Bring 20 silk, 50 wood, and 50 stone blocks to Elara</p>
<p>Elara thanks you for your work, and says that the Lodge should be substantially repaired next time you come back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, she asks you another question - if you'd be able to kill a variety of airborne enemies, as it'd make her and the other townspeople feel safer. Additionally, she still needs more materials, so after that, to bring her the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>40 Wood</li>
  <li>10 Gel</li>
  <li>20 Iron or Lead Bars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Kill 10 Demon Eyes, Crimera, or Eater of Souls<br><strong>Next:</strong> Bring her 40 Wood, 10 Gel, 20 Iron/Lead Bars</p>
<p>Elara thanks you a lot for your work. She says that the next time you return, the Lodge should be fully ready to go. She then also teaches you a skill she had learned as a hunter, the Rain of Arrows skill. The quest is complete at this point.</p>
<h4>Reward</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Learn the Rain of Arrows Skill</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p>“<i>Greetings traveler. Need a keen eye and a steady hand?”</i><br><i>“I've tracked a beast through these woods many times. Care to join the hunt?”</i><br><i>“Be cautious out there. The forest hides many secrets.”</i><br><i>“You've returned. Hope your misadventures are treating you well."</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>'Drawing the Bow' Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“You've surely seen the damage here. Much like my fellow townsmen, I don't know what happened. But we repair anyhow. Would I bother you to grab some supplies? I've got to check inventory for a while.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After handing in first set of materials:</strong><br><i>“Oh my, so soon? Infinite thanks, my friend. I'll get right to repairing; next time you come back, you should see a nicer Lodge. Not…perfect, though. Take this bow. It's a trusty one. May you be so kind as to kill a few airborne hostiles for me? Ravencrest would appreciate it, as would I. And, if I may be so bold, could I ask for a bit more building materials? The shop would enjoy that.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After handing in second set of materials:</strong><br><i>“How wonderful. The Lodge will return to its former glory, thanks to you. Feel free to come when you wish; I will support you as I can. Say, take this; I trained for many years as a ranger. The Flurry has helped me many times. May it help you too.”</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Frigid Beast’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>After giving Rhine the Strange Antlers:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>A Deerclops, you say? Lass called Rhine told you about it? Large, dangerous beast. I don't see much worth in treading its domain, it's...haunted in some form. No matter. Give me a moment...here. Be truly and deeply careful, the dark is always present and always dangerous.”</i></p>
<p><strong>When trying to buy the Deerclops map:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>Here. Thanks for your contribution. Hope it goes better this time.”</i><br><i>"You'll need a little more coin for another map, I'm afraid. You know how it is."</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Unleashing Chaos’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>After talking to Alaric:</strong><br><i>"Take care, and take this. I'm no fancy weaponsmith, but Thrain helped with it. Keeps it simple. And - the eyes are weakest."</i></p>
