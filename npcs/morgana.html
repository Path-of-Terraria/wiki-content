<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana mentions she can teach you about the secrets of summoning. She asks for you to retrieve a few items to demonstrate. She hands you a Grimoire, an ancient book of much power, and explains that it needs materials to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She asks you to retrieve the following items:</p>
<p>* 1 <a href="https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/Items/Owl-Feather">Owl Feather</a></p>

<p><strong>Next: </strong>Bring the Grimoire materials to Morgana</p>
<p>Upon bringing these items she rewards you by providing you the <a href="/Items/Grimoire">Grimoire </a>Item and she also provides you one full summon set for the Owl summon.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Summon the Owl from the Grimoire<br><strong>Next:</strong> Talk to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana will comment that, while not flashy, the Owl and the other summons in the Grimoire will help the player a lot. She then ends the quest.</p>

<h3>Boss Domain Quest - A Royal Adventure</h3>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Talk to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana mentions she needs a few things from the jungle, namely some stingers. Get her 5 stingers, and she can give you something nice for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Obtain 5 stingers<br><strong>Next: </strong>Return to Morgana with the stingers</p>
<p>She thanks you for the stingers, and gives you a rare Grimoire material for your troubles, unlocking the Hornet grimoire summon.</p>
<p>After thanking you, she asks for one last favor...for now. There's a bee in the jungle, a Queen Bee, that she'd like felled. She says it makes her foraging much less comfortable when a gargantuan bee could bother her at any given moment. She'll reward you kindly for such a deal.</p>
<p>She says to summon your Hornet summon and submerge it in honey for a bit, and a portal to the Queen Bee's lair will automagically open. Good luck! Don't ask how that works.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Kill the Queen Bee<br><strong>Next: </strong>Return to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana thanks you for your deal, and ends the quest.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>7500 experience</li>

  <li>Queen Bee map drops randomly from any enemy (1/1000)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p>“<i>Yes…the brew speaks!…it says you're looking to buy! Hm? Are you?”</i><br><i>“Mix! Mix! I say, making the most peculiar brews you've heard of. Yes, more Strange than Strange Brews.”</i><br><i>“The tail of a rat! The wings of a bat! And to this, I say - rhyme? What's that?”</i><br><i>“Betwixt toil and trouble, I reside. Care for a concoction of devilish proportions? Do you? Do you?”</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘The Ancient Art’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“Your guiles intrigue me, stranger. I've summoned the most twisted of creatures before…do you wish to do the same? Do you? If your conviction holds; bring me the the feather of an owl, the wings of a bat, and the tail of a scorpion. And take this! The Grimoire will help you along. It will, won't it! Bahaha!”</i> &nbsp;- &nbsp;<strong>Here, Morgana incorrectly lists the ingredients needed for the first quest, adding on ‘the tail of a scorpion’ which is not needed for the quest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After collecting materials:</strong><br><i>“Bahaha! You return, my trinkets unobscured! Perfection, stranger. Just for my own sake, I ask, with haste - open your Grimoire and summon whichever beast you like! Owl, bat - which should it be? Hm? Hm?! Be merry, and may the phoenix find you well!”</i></p>
<p><strong>After showing Morgana a Grimoire summon:</strong><br><i>“There he is! Your very own summon! Bewitching, isn't it, stranger? Alas, to toil I return. Your Grimoire will serve you well, as it did me. Explore, the creatures of the world can bewilder. Especially if you're a hunter - the materials you gather may summon many different creatures!”</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>'A Royal Adventure' Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“Ah! You return! My guiles are favourable, yes? Yes! I have a query to ask yo! Perhaps odd, but normal for one such as I! Yes! I've harkened back to a more…natural time of my life, and I wish to have some of that soul back. Could I ask you to fetch me some hornet's stingers from the jungle? Could I? Could I? You'll get a nice reward if you do.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After giving Morgana stingers:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>How wonderful! Yes...here. Take this little morsel. It'll help you summon a cute little fiend from your Grimoire. Cruel, but kind! Alas, I have one more thing to ask. A creature most foul resides in the jungle, one Queen of Bees. Could I ask you to slay it? It seeks to bother me, and I wish it dead! Another award awaits you! Submerge your new hornet friend in honey if you wish to battle!”</i></p>
