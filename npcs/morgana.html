<h3>Boss Domain Quest - A Royal Adventure</h3>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Talk to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana mentions she needs a few things from the jungle, namely some stingers. Get her 5 stingers, and she can give you something nice for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Obtain 5 stingers<br><strong>Next: </strong>Return to Morgana with the stingers</p>
<p>She thanks you for the stingers, and gives you a rare Grimoire material for your troubles, unlocking the Hornet grimoire summon.</p>
<p>After thanking you, she asks for one last favor...for now. There's a bee in the jungle, a Queen Bee, that she'd like felled. She says it makes her foraging much less comfortable when a gargantuan bee could bother her at any given moment. She'll reward you kindly for such a deal.</p>
<p>She says to summon your Hornet summon and submerge it in honey for a bit, and a portal to the Queen Bee's lair will automagically open. Good luck! Don't ask how that works.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Kill the Queen Bee<br><strong>Next: </strong>Return to Morgana</p>
<p>Morgana thanks you for your deal, and ends the quest.</p>
