<p><strong>Alaric</strong> is a wise wizard that serves as the Magic class NPC for Path of Terraria.</p>
<p>He is wearing a blue and yellow wizard robe &amp; hat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Alaric can be found wandering the library in the Town of <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First Class Quest - Magical Returnal</h3>
<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric mentions that one of the losses from the recent raid of Goblins was a book called the “Tome of the Elders”, a vaguely powerful book full of powers untold. While he claims the book is only usable by the strongest wizards in the world, any knowledge in that book could be used for evil. He asks you to return it.</p>
<p>All goblin types, including Scouts, will now have a 1/10 chance to drop the “Tome of the Elders”.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Bring Alaric the Tome of the Elders</p>
<p>Alaric thanks you, and offers you a (quote) “mote of his power!". The quest then ends.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Nova Skill</li>
  <li>A Magic rarity Staff</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boss Domain Quest - Unleashing Chaos</h3>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Experience an earthquake in the Underworld</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric, solemn and unlike his usual…insanity…talks clearly and directly about the tremors the Underworld, and soon, the whole world will experience. He comments on how a long time ago, four powerful warriors locked away a great beast. However, in recent times, that beast has been growing in power, causing chaos.</p>
<p>As such, he asks you go talk to all three other class NPCs - Thrain, Elara and Morgana - as they will give you boons to fight against the incoming fight. He himself offers you a nice new weapon, a not at all egocentric or self-serving showcase of his power, the <a href="/Items/Uniques/TinyHat">Tiny Hat</a>…and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Talk to Thrain Ironfist, Elara, and Morgana</p>
<p><u>Thrain:</u> He solemnly says he'd been expecting something like this, and offers you his prized sword, the <a href="/Items/Unique/DwarvenGreatsword">Dwarven Greatsword</a>. He mentions that Alaric helped him create it, and imbued it with a bit of Thrain's battle history. He wishes you well.</p>
<p><u>Elara:</u> She, not substantially less terse than usual, offers you the <a href="/npcs/Unique/Twinbow">Twinbow</a>, made with help from Thrain. “The eyes are weak.” is what she leaves you with.</p>
<p><u>Morgana:</u> Almost completely nonplussed, she offers you 3 of both the Flaming Eye and the Soulful Ash <a href="/Items/Grimoire">Grimoire</a> materials. She says you'll do great, and cackles as you leave.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric hands you a Void Pearl, which he says - if thrown upon the ashes of Hell - will summon a portal to the Wall's domain. He knows one thing: You only have one chance in the Wall's domain; you do not have multiple lives. What he does not know, however, is what happens after the Wall is killed.</p>
<p>Yet, you must.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Kill the Wall of Flesh</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Mostly back to his crazed and unhinged self, Alaric thanks you. He mentions that he has many things to test now, but gives you a reward. The quest ends.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>15000 Experience</li>
  <li>A Unique Amulet/Charm</li>
  <li>A Unique Chestplate</li>
  <li>Wall of Flesh map drops randomly from any enemy (1/1000)</li>
  <li>A fun time in Hardmode</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p><i>“Magic is scary. Once, I saw someone turn their hand into a rat. What's the lesson? I don't know."</i><br><i>“Wisdom holds many powers. Angel Statues once did something. It was…well…so…ahem. time can only tell.”</i><br><i>“I've seen the throughline of your destiny. I cannot, for the life of me, put it to words.”</i><br><i>“Ah! I almost turned you into a mole the size of a god. Beware my strength!”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Magical Returnal’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“Hm. You saw the damage everywhere. Alas! My powers cannot reconstitute the world. I'm far busier on…my…projects. Yes! Alas, I have something more pressing. A goblin burglar took one of my tomes. Powerful as it is, it has to be harnessed by a strong wizard. I suspect they are looking through the tome to learn it's secrets…so with haste, return it! I will grant you powers beyond imagination. I will be here, individually placing books on shelves with the strength of magic.”</i></p>
