<p><strong>Alaric</strong> is a wise wizard that serves as the Magic class NPC for Path of Terraria.</p>
<p>He is wearing a blue and yellow wizard robe &amp; hat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Alaric can be found wandering the library in the Town of <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>First Class Quest - Magical Returnal</h3>
<p><strong>Start: </strong>Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric mentions that one of the losses from the recent raid of Goblins was a book called the “Tome of the Elders”, a vaguely powerful book full of powers untold. While he claims the book is only usable by the strongest wizards in the world, any knowledge in that book could be used for evil. He asks you to return it.</p>
<p>All goblin types, including Scouts, will now have a 1/10 chance to drop the “Tome of the Elders”.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Bring Alaric the Tome of the Elders</p>
<p>Alaric thanks you, and offers you a (quote) “mote of his power!". The quest then ends.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Nova Skill</li>
  <li>A Magic rarity Staff</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boss Domain Quest - Unleashing Chaos</h3>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Experience an earthquake in the Underworld</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric, solemn and unlike his usual…insanity…talks clearly and directly about the tremors the Underworld, and soon, the whole world will experience. He comments on how a long time ago, four powerful warriors locked away a great beast. However, in recent times, that beast has been growing in power, causing chaos.</p>
<p>As such, he asks you go talk to all three other class NPCs - Thrain, Elara and Morgana - as they will give you boons to fight against the incoming fight. He himself offers you a nice new weapon, a not at all egocentric or self-serving showcase of his power, the <a href="/Items/Uniques/TinyHat">Tiny Hat</a>…and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Next: </strong>Talk to Thrain Ironfist, Elara, and Morgana</p>
<p><u>Thrain:</u> He solemnly says he'd been expecting something like this, and offers you his prized sword, the <a href="/Items/Unique/DwarvenGreatsword">Dwarven Greatsword</a>. He mentions that Alaric helped him create it, and imbued it with a bit of Thrain's battle history. He wishes you well.</p>
<p><u>Elara:</u> She, not substantially less terse than usual, offers you the <a href="/npcs/Unique/Twinbow">Twinbow</a>, made with help from Thrain. “The eyes are weak.” is what she leaves you with.</p>
<p><u>Morgana:</u> Almost completely nonplussed, she offers you 3 of both the Flaming Eye and the Soulful Ash <a href="/Items/Grimoire">Grimoire</a> materials. She says you'll do great, and cackles as you leave.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Alaric hands you a Void Pearl, which he says - if thrown upon the ashes of Hell - will summon a portal to the Wall's domain. He knows one thing: You only have one chance in the Wall's domain; you do not have multiple lives. What he does not know, however, is what happens after the Wall is killed.</p>
<p>Yet, you must.</p>
<p><strong>Next:</strong> Kill the Wall of Flesh</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Talk to Alaric</p>
<p>Mostly back to his crazed and unhinged self, Alaric thanks you. He mentions that he has many things to test now, but gives you a reward. The quest ends.</p>
<h4>Rewards</h4>
<ul>
  <li>15000 Experience</li>
  <li>A Unique Amulet/Charm</li>
  <li>A Unique Chestplate</li>
  <li>Wall of Flesh map drops randomly from any enemy (1/1000)</li>
  <li>A fun time in Hardmode</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<h4>General Dialogue</h4>
<p><i>“Magic is scary. Once, I saw someone turn their hand into a rat. What's the lesson? I don't know."</i><br><i>“Wisdom holds many powers. Angel Statues once did something. It was…well…so…ahem. time can only tell.”</i><br><i>“I've seen the throughline of your destiny. I cannot, for the life of me, put it to words.”</i><br><i>“Ah! I almost turned you into a mole the size of a god. Beware my strength!”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>‘Magical Returnal’ Quest</h4>
<p><strong>Upon starting:</strong><br><i>“Hm. You saw the damage everywhere. Alas! My powers cannot reconstitute the world. I'm far busier on…my…projects. Yes! Alas, I have something more pressing. A goblin burglar took one of my tomes. Powerful as it is, it has to be harnessed by a strong wizard. I suspect they are looking through the tome to learn it's secrets…so with haste, return it! I will grant you powers beyond imagination. I will be here, individually placing books on shelves with the strength of magic.”</i></p>
<p><strong>After returning the Tome of the Elders</strong><br><i>"Aha! Thank you kindly. Your kindness will be rewarded greatly! My powers will push you forward at all times. Here, take a mote of power; a Nova is but a portion of my strength! As for the Library...my strength renewed, it will be repaired by the time you return! Books organized like you've never seen before! Behold it and weep...soon!"</i><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>'Unleashing Chaos' Quest</h4>
<p><strong>When spoken to after Quest start:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>Hm....yes. The ground deep beneath us all shakes with a vigor, from the one they hid away. You see, long ago, a group of adventurers locked an evil into a fascimile. However, with your incredible strength slaying all these beasts around the world, that power seems to have crept its way to that locked evil. Which is to say, we must kill it. Talk to Thrain, Morgana and Elara as soon as you can. They understand, and will give you weapons. Take this, and godspeed. You can thank Morgana for this, too. Just...don't ask about it too much. Busy days here!”</i></p>
<p><strong>After talking to the other townsfolk:</strong><br><i>“Here you are. Well, take these. These are...yes...explosive, but it's just how it works. I swear. Throw these upon the ashes of Hell to open a portal to the place that the Wall was confined to. Note - you will have one chance to kill it. No mistakes. And we don't know what happens upon the wall's death. Much is uncertain, aside from that it must die. Good luck. If you need any more, I can summon some...for a small price! Sorry! Commerce never hides!”</i></p>
<p><strong>After defeating the Wall of Flesh:</strong><br><i><strong>“</strong>You return! We see many changes, but the earth won't shake and shutter under us any longer. Prepare yourself for the future, as there is much to learn. Especially for myself, for I have...a lot of stuff to try out."</i></p>
