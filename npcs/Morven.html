<p>Morven is an older scientist equipped with various trinkets and tools, found in the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Underground_Corruption">Underground Corruption</a> after beating the Eye of Cthulhu's domain.</p>
<p>Morven has a tattered lab coat with work pants, alongside a backpack overfull of mechanical and electrical equipment. He visibly wears Rocket Boots and a gun holster as well. Generally speaking, he doesn't like to speak and is unkind, but smart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>After the Eye of Cthulhu is defeated Morven can be found in the Underground Corruption. Morven is entombed by a ring of stalagmites that entrap him in place. He will be calling out to nearby players with a message like this somewhere on screen, fading in more the closer you get:</p>

<p>He can be freed by breaking or mining the stalactites around him.</p>

<h3>Boss Domain Quest - Whispers of the Deep</h3>
<p><strong>Starting</strong>: Find and Speak to Morven in the Underground Corruption</p>
<p>Morven mentions he was studying the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Devourer">Devourers</a> in the area but that he had some issues with his tools and he somehow become entombed in ebonstone. Morven reluctantly asks to be lead out of this place, for a reward.</p>
<p>You are tasked with keeping him alive. Note that if he gets stuck, he will teleport - but his teleporter will cause large damage to him, so you must be careful. If he dies, he will be teleported nearby randomly and require any Healing Potion to recover and continue the quest - and berate you for your failure.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Take Morven to <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest</a></p>
<p>Morven passing by the Ravencrest Statue will allow him to travel there. He will then appear in the spawn location of Ravencrest.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Speak to Morven in the center of Ravencrest</p>
<p>Morven explains more of his research into the Underground Corruption. He mentions how he tagged some Devourers, but also had the side effect of being able to look at some Shadow Orbs. He then asks you to destroy a few, “Just to see what happens.”</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Destroy 3 Shadow Orbs</p>
<p>Upon destroying the 3rd orb there is a loud rumbling and a chasm opens to the side of the orb, building into a small tunnel ending in a portal to the Eater of World's domain.</p>

</figure>
<p>The portal remains for the same amount of times as a Boss Map does on a Map Device.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Enter the Eater of Worlds Domain &amp; Defeat the Eater of Worlds</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Return back to Morven to complete the quest</p>
<p>Morven begrudgingly acknowledges your great help to his research, and completes the quest. He also notes that implies many things, but does not specify what.</p>
<p><strong>Completion &amp; Rewards</strong></p>
<p>Upon defeating the Eater of Worlds, the Eater of Worlds boss domain map can now be dropped as a global item. (1/1000)</p>
<p>You are rewarded with 7500 Experience</p>
<p>You are rewarded with a rare accessory (Amulet or Ring)</p>
