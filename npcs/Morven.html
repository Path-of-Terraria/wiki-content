<p>Morven is an old, grim wanderer who once studied the natural order of the world but was tainted by the corruption that spreads from deep within the land. He is somewhat of a keeper of forbidden knowledge and understands the dark forces that birthed the Eater of Worlds.</p>
<p>Morven has a tattered cloak with dark green and purple accents, patches of corruption growing on his skin. He carries a twisted staff made from corrupted wood.</p>
