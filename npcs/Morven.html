<p>Morven is an old, grim wanderer who once studied the natural order of the world but was tainted by the corruption that spreads from deep within the land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morven has a tattered cloak with dark green and purple accents, patches of corruption growing on his skin. He carries a twisted staff made from corrupted wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>After the Eye of Cthulhu is defeated Morven can be found in the <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Underground_Corruption">Underground Corruption</a> . Morven is entombed by a ring of stalagmites that seemingly grew out of nowhere and at incredible speed.</p>
