<p>The Goblin Army event can only happen in the Town of Ravencrest and certain criteria has been met</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Criteria</h4>
<ul>
  <li>King Slime has been Defeated in his Domain</li>
  <li>There must be no Goblin Invasion already in progress.</li>
  <li>At least one player must have 200 health or more</li>
  <li>At least one Shadow Orb or Crimson Heart must have been destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Starting the Event</h4>
<p>If you have not completed the Goblin Army event yet and the above criteria has been met when you enter the town of Ravencrest there will be a Goblin Scout surveying the area. If you defeat this goblin scout the Goblin Army event will be triggered.</p>
<p>If you let the Goblin live the goblin will report that the town is guarded by a warrior and not to attack the town.</p>
<p>If you have already defeated the Goblin Army Event then the chance for this Goblin Scout to appear when entering Ravencrest is 1/10</p>
