<p>Bossing in Path of Terraria is different from how the Vanilla game handles bossing. All bossing is done in the “Bosses Domain”. Boss domains are unlocked through Quest Progression and cannot be done the normal vanilla way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>All Boss Summoning Items are Disabled</h4>
<p>Boss summons are disabled in this mod and are intended to be fought in their respective Boss Domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Lives System</h4>
<p>When fighting a boss domain you are given 6 lives. Lives are determined by the players that joined the boss domain through the portal. All players get at least 1 life though.</p>
<p>For example:<br>Singleplayer: Enter world, you have 6 lives.<br>Multiplayer:<br>2 players: Enter world, you both have 3 lives.<br>6 players: Enter world, you all have 1 life.<br>12 players: Enter world, you all have 1 life.</p>
<p>If a player dies and has no lives remaining in the subworld, they are turned into a ghost until the boss is dead or everyone else is. At this point, a short timer begins and players return to the main world in unison.</p>
