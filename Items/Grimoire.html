<p>The <strong>Grimoire </strong>is a specialty summoning item where you put pieces of monsters together to assemble a summon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summons require 3-5 Grimoire materials to be assembled to create a summon. The grimoire acts as the weapon allowing you to directly control the summon instead of acting like other summons. Additionally, these Grimoire materials carry the affixes that modify your summon.</p>
<h2>Obtainment</h2>
<p>The Grimoire can be obtained by talking to the Witch, Morgana, in her home in Ravencrest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her quest has you take a Grimoire, search for a few Owl Feathers and a pair of Bat Wings in order to summon the Owl. Summoning the owl completes the quest. This also permanently unlocks the Menagerie, the place where you set up, modify and select your Grimoire summon.</p>
<p>The materials are obtained by various creatures in the world, listed here:</p>

<h2>The Menagerie</h2>

<p>The Menagerie is split into 3 panels: Storage, Summon and Sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Storage contains all of the Grimoire materials you've accrued while playing. Hovering over an item shows you its tooltips. Importantly, Grimoire materials with affixes will have a green indicator so you can more easily find useful materials.</p>
<p>Shift+click on an item in storage to throw it away. That item will stay in the trash slot unless removed, overridden by throwing away an item, or restarting the game.</p>
<p>Storage is per-player - no one else can modify your Menagerie, and switching to a new player will restart the Grimoire. This goes for all panels.</p>
<h3>Summon</h3>
<p>The Summon section contains a selection of summons for you to choose. Your currently selected summon is shown in the icon right above the Sacrifice panel, with a dashed line square if one isn't selected.</p>
<p>Selecting a summon will allow you to use and control it as you would a weapon like the Magic Missile. The item does nothing without a summon selected.</p>
<p>Summons have to be unlocked using a small set of Grimoire materials. If they haven't been unlocked, the icon will be grayed out and not be usable. It's important to note that once you unlock a summon, you have it permanently unlocked it for your player. Trashing all of your Grimoire materials will not remove any of your summons despite no longer having the required items.</p>
<p>Finally, all Summons have an additional skill if you have them out and click right click. That functionality, alongside their unlock materials, will be noted below. (Right click functionality not yet added).</p>
<h4>Available Summons</h4>
<p><strong>Owl </strong>- Two Owl Feathers, One Bat Wing<br>The Owl flies around the cursor loosely, damaging anything it touches.</p>
<p><strong>Bat </strong>- Two Bat Wings, One Owl Feather<br>The Bat flies around the cursor aggressively, damaging anything it touches.</p>
<p><strong>Poacher </strong>- Two Scorpion Tails, One Owl Feather, One Bat Wing<br>The Poacher runs along the ground and climbs along the wall, damaging anything it touches.</p>
<p><strong>Hornet </strong>- One Large Stinger, One Bat Wings<br>The Horney flies around the cursor, shooting stingers at nearby enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Podoboom</strong> - Three Flaming Eyes, One Soulful Ash<br>The Podoboom repeatedly dashes towards the cursor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it hits enemies (or is submerged in lava), it grows in size, becoming larger and slower. Right clicking explodes the Podoboom, resetting its size and dealing massive damage in an area. The larger the Podoboom is, the bigger the explosion is and the higher the damage is.</p>
<p><strong>Demon</strong> - Three Soulful Ashes, One Flaming Eye<br>The Demon flies around the cursor, shooting various demonic weapons towards the strongest nearby enemy.</p>
<h3>Sacrifice</h3>
<p>The Sacrifice panel allows you to boost your summon with affixed Grimoire materials. For example, an Owl Feather with +2 flat damage will grant +2 damage to your summon. Despite the name, Grimoire summons are not deleted and you can remove “sacrificed” materials back into Storage and vise-versa freely.</p>
