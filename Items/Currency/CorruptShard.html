<p>The corrupt shard modifies an item unpredictably. You can corrupt a normal, magic, rare, or unique item. Information on what can happen can be found below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When the item is a unique</h3>
<p>50% = Nothing Happens<br>25% = Item downgrades to a rare , that is from the same base type as the unique, and rolls new affixes<br>25% = Item receives a new "Corruption Implicit" Affix that is an additional affix on the item. Now totaling 5 affixes possible. Implicit added is randomly rolled and is weighted. So the higher weight affixes roll more commonly.</p>
