<p>There are several ways you can contribute to the project. Regardless if you know how to code, sprite, or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Public Repositories</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Website</h4>
<p>The website requires Node 20 or later. I highly suggest using NVM to manage your node versions. This can be installed with chocolatey as well.</p>
<p><code>choco install nvm</code></p>
<p>Once you have nvm you can install Node versions. You can use <code>nvm install 22</code> to get version 22 of nodejs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Private Repositories</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>API</h4>
<p>There are a few private repos due to anti-cheat methods and API authentication for the online experience. Only the Online Mod and the API itself are private and everything else is public.</p>
<p>To work on these repositories you will need the following installed</p>
<ul>
  <li>MySQL Local Server</li>
  <li>MySQL Workbench (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly suggest using <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey </a>for this</p>
<p>You can install these prerequisites using the following commands</p>
<p><code>choco install mysql</code>&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>choco install mysql.workbench</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
