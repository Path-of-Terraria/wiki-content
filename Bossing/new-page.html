<p><span class="text-big"><strong>How to start the quest to defeat her</strong></span></p>
<hr>
<p>The path to defeating the Queen Slime begins immediately after entering Hardmode.</p>
<p>To complete the quest, we need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explore 10 Tier 1 maps (IMPORTANT: only Tier 1).</li>
  <li>Enter the Queen Slime’s Lair.</li>
  <li>Defeat the Queen Slime.</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be a bug, BUT you must specifically complete the “Forest” or “Desert” maps.</p>
<p>After completing the 10th map, the Queen Slime Map will drop into your inventory.</p>

<p>No noticeable changes in the boss’s behavior have been observed, and the loot remains the same.</p>
