<h3>Getting to the Domain</h3>
<p>There are two ways to enter the Eye's domain:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use an Eye of Cthulhu Map on a Map Device and enter, which is dropped by any npc (1/1000 chance) after The Rising Omen quest is completed</li>
  <li>Break open a Lunar Concoction, given to you by <a href="/npcs/Eldric">Eldric</a> during The Rising Omen quest</li>
</ol>
