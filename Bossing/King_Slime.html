<h3>Getting to the King Slime Domain</h3>
<p>After completing the first class quest on your world a new NPC called <a href="/npcs/Garrick"><strong>Garrick</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>will appear in the tavern in Ravencrest.</p>
<p>Talking to Garrick will task you with a quest to collect 5 Iron/Lead, 5 Gold/Platinum, and 1 Ruby to help build a map device. Bringing these materials back to Garrick will give you this device, as well as a map to enter with it.</p>
<p>You can use this map with the Map Device to open a portal to the King's Domain.</p>
<p>Garrick's page will explain the quest, <a href="https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Quests"><strong>Kill the King.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Defeating King Slime</h3>
<p>Once you defeat the King Slime you can now receive the King Slime Domain Map as a global drop.</p>
<p>This will allow you to fight through the King Slime Domain once again.</p>
