<p>Important aspects of any ARPG is itemization, drops, and the end-game pushing progression.</p>
<p>Killing enemies [drops ](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Drops) [Gear](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Gear)</p>
<p>Gear roll with [Modifiers](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/Mechanics/Modifiers)</p>
<p>Gear can drop as Normal, Magic, Rare, or Unique. These determines how many modifiers can appear on an item.</p>
<p>There are several different base weapons and each of them have their own playstyle and alternative use.</p>
<p>We have several custom [NPCS](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/npcs), [Quests](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Quests), and even a [town](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Towns)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Bossing](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Bossing) is handled completely different. Changing how progression works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be two different mods.</p>
<p>`Path of Terraria` The main mod that has all of the content in it.</p>
<p>`Path of Terraria Online` This mod takes aspect of Path of Terraria and turns it into online play. This includes the [leaderboard](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Leaderboards) system and in the future will enable trading between players through an Auction House of sorts.</p>
