<p>Rooted is a debuff that locks your target in place for a period of time. By default it is 1 second.</p>
<p>An enemy can only be rooted once every 4 seconds, therefore if you root and enemy for 1 second it cannot be rooted for 3 seconds after it's root expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bosses are immune to this debuff.</p>
