# Gear
## How it Works
Gear obtained in Path of Terraria is different from how gear in vanilla terraria works so in this article we will go over what those differences are and understanding what to expect. 

All vanilla gear can also be upgraded through the [Currency Crafting](/Items/Currency) system. The items listed here are unique to Path of Terraria and represent custom content. Refer to the vanilla terraria wiki on what gear can be acquired and know that those can be modified.

Gear dropped with a set "Item Level". Item level determines what affixes, and the tier of those affies, can drop on a given item. Item Level is the area level at which the item level dropped. So inside an area level of 55, all gear dropped within that area will have Item Level 55. Item level cannot be modified. Certain affixes will only unlock at certain item levels, allowing you to discover and find new affixes as you progress

## Affixes

Affixes are [Modifiers](/Mechanics/Modifiers) that enhance the ability of an item. The amount of affixes is based on the Gear Rarity. The types of affixes that can appear on items depend on the gear itself.

## Rarity

Gear has 4 different rarity types

-   Common
-   Magic (Up to 2 Affixes)
-   Rare (Up to 4 Affixes)
-   [Unique](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Gear/Uniques) (Set Affixes)
