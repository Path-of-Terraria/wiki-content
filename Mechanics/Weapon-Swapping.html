<p>In Path of Terraria there is hidden weapon slot that allows you to switch between weapons in your main hand.</p>
<p>To do so, you must set a Hotkey for this action. You can find this under Settings → Controls → Mod Controls → Path of Terraria → Swap Weapon</p>
<p>When you assign and use this button it will swap your main hand weapon for the other in the respective slot.</p>
