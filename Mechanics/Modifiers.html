<p>Modifiers generally change various aspects of the entity they are affecting. Most commonly modifiers apply stats, however they can also apply buffs or grant skills and can often be found on items, monsters, strongboxes or areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A modifier should be seen as an instance of change applied to an entity. A basic modifier does nothing on its own, it is given the effect by the associated stats (and their values), buffs and skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A modifier applies statistics, a buff or grants a skill to an entity. Modifiers are specific to items, monsters, or areas (maps and domains).</p>
<p>Modifiers can either be innately applied (as "implicit" modifier) to entities, be granted under specific conditions.</p>
<p>The values of stats include a minimum and maximum value, which is most commonly used on items - the actual value of the stat in the cases where minimum and maximum are not the same will be randomized within with equal chances, so for example a Stat with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 3, can either be 1, 2 or 3 at 1/3 chance for each value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>In general modifiers are referred to as such, however there are many special cases of modifiers that correspond to specific items.</p>
