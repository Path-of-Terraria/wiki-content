<p>Block is a mechanic that will prevent damage from a source where you would normally take damage, unless explicitly stated otherwise through a passive or affix. There are certain sources of damage that cannot be blocked. They will be explicitly stated in their respective articles for the monster.</p>
<p>Block is based on a chance. When you would normally take damage and you have a source of block it may activate and prevent the damage.</p>
<p>Block has a hard cap at 40%</p>

<h3>Sources of Block</h3>
<p>Block can be granted through off-hands, such as <a href="/Gear/Shield">shields</a>, as a starting point and can be further enhanced through <a href="/Mechanics/Modifiers">Modifiers </a>or Passives.</p>
<p>If an offhand would provide block chance it would specify the block chance is is providing at the top of the item tooltip.</p>
