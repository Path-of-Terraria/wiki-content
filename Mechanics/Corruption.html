<p>Corruption in Path of Terraria works much like other games. Corrupting an item will prevent it from being modified further by currency shards and has a chance to break the item you use it on.</p>
<h3>When the item is a unique</h3>
<p>50% = Nothing Happens<br>25% = Item downgrades to a rare , that is from the same base type as the unique, and rolls new affixes<br>25% = Item receives a new "Corruption Implicit" Affix that is an additional affix on the item. Now totaling 5 affixes possible. Implicit added is randomly rolled and is weighted. So the higher weight affixes roll more commonly.</p>
<h3>When the item is a rare/magic/normal</h3>
<p>50% = Nothing Happens<br>50% = Item receives a new "Corruption Implicit" Affix that is an additional affix on the item. Now totaling 5 affixes possible. Implicit added is randomly rolled and is weighted. So the higher weight affixes roll more commonly.</p>
<p>Corruption Implicits - To be expanded upon later</p>
<ul>
  <li>+10-20 Life (500 Weighting)</li>
  <li>+4-6 Defense (500 Weighting)</li>
  <li>+5% Increased Attack Speed (50 Weighting)</li>
</ul>
