<ul>
  <li>Adjusted the drop rates of currencies. Echoing shard should be more rare now. Skill augmentation orbs should be more rare now.</li>
  <li>Resolves a Softlock with Morven and being unable to break orbs</li>
  <li>Disables Pirate Map Usage in Subworlds</li>
  <li>Explorable Maps and Boss Domain maps drop tables have been split. When the drop table say to drop a map, it should now be a 70% explorable map, and 30% boss map. Instead of just a diluted pool of explorable maps. Roughly 250% increased drop rate of explorable maps</li>
  <li>Fixes the Fishron Map incorrectly opening the Queen Bee domain</li>
</ul>
