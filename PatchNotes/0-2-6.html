<ul>
  <li>Adjusted the drop rates of currencies. Echoing shard should be more rare now. Skill augmentation orbs should be more rare now.</li>
  <li>Resolves a Softlock with Morven and being unable to break orbs</li>
  <li>Disables Pirate Map Usage in Subworlds</li>
  <li>Explorable Maps and Boss Domain maps drop tables have been split. When the drop table say to drop a map, it should now be a 70% explorable map, and 30% boss map. Instead of just a diluted pool of explorable maps. Roughly 250% increased drop rate of explorable maps</li>
  <li>Fixes the Fishron Map incorrectly opening the Queen Bee domain</li>

  <li>Fixes Empress death not counting for Boss Tracker</li>
  <li>Nerfs a ton of Skeletron domain rooms, making them substantially easier, less unfair, and more consistent</li>

  <li>Nerfs Skeletron domain's spikeballs a lot, significantly reducing damage</li>
  <li>Adds the Attack/Cast Speed line to weapon tooltips</li>
