<ul>
  <li>Fixed how an implicit counted as a 4th affix for ascendant shards</li>
  <li>Crafted items now reflect current area level.</li>
  <li>Adjusted critical strike chance multiplier node on tree to be actually 10% base (was previously way too multiplicative, was giving like 5-10% flat per level)</li>
