<blockquote>
  <p>This is not yet released</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed how an implicit counted as a 4th affix for ascendant shards</li>
  <li>Crafted items now reflect current area level.</li>
  <li>Adjusted critical strike chance multiplier node on tree to be actually 10% base (was previously way too multiplicative, was giving like 5-10% flat per level)</li>
  <li>Changed how critical strike chance multiplier is handled on weapon affix. Previously did nothing.</li>
  <li>Adjusted the rolls of all critical affixes on weapons (previously way too high.)</li>
  <li>Changed right click functionality specifically for accessories when in inventory, so they can now be clicked into the custom slots.</li>
  <li>Changed rings and amulet vanities to be equippable</li>
  <li>Fixes the 3rd accessory slot not able to be used properly</li>
  <li>Added a 4th accessory slot that is unlocked in Hardmode</li>
  <li>Fixed all gear slots so they're now in the right place.</li>
  <li>Tooltips have been completely reworked.<ul>
      <li>They now visually match the rest of our Custom UI</li>
      <li>They now show for all items when dragging an item, not just PoT items.</li>
      <li>When holding an item, and hovering over another it will display both tooltips.</li>
      <li>Names now correctly show their rarity color when holding the item</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Made Blood Oath and Fire Starter about 5x less common, Burning Red Boots about 50x more common&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Completely reworked how drop tables work. There is now proper item rarity stacking for deeper exploration map tiers and enables us to have item rarity on gear in a follow up&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>Do note that there were several bugs found in the acquisition of items through the drop table. This will result in the more rare shards to become MUCH more rare as the previous values were not properly respected.</li>
      <li>Expect Echoing shards to be 50x+ more rare</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
