<ul>
  <li>Fixed how an implicit counted as a 4th affix for ascendant shards, just added an IsImplicit to track if it is one.</li>
  <li>Changed the previous affix tooltip code to add to existing values properly...</li>
  <li>Small change to HasMaxAffixesForRarity for the implicit reason, needed to track it</li>
  <li>Crafted items now reflect current area level.</li>
  <li>Adjusted critical strike chance multiplier node on tree to be actually 10% base (was previously way too multiplicative, was giving like 5-10% flat per level)</li>
  <li>Changed how critical strike chance multiplier is handled on weapon affix. Previously did nothing.</li>
  <li>Adjusted the rolls of all critical affixes on weapons (previously way too high.)</li>
