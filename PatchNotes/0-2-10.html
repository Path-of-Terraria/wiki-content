<ul>
  <li>Fixed how an implicit counted as a 4th affix for ascendant shards</li>
  <li>Crafted items now reflect current area level.</li>
  <li>Adjusted critical strike chance multiplier node on tree to be actually 10% base (was previously way too multiplicative, was giving like 5-10% flat per level)</li>
  <li>Changed how critical strike chance multiplier is handled on weapon affix. Previously did nothing.</li>
  <li>Adjusted the rolls of all critical affixes on weapons (previously way too high.)</li>

  </li>
  <li>Made Blood Oath and Fire Starter about 5x less common, Burning Red Boots about 50x more common</li>
  <li>Completely reworked how drop tables work. There is now proper item rarity stacking for deeper exploration map tiers and enables us to have item rarity on gear in a follow up<ul>
      <li>Do note that there were several bugs found in the acquisition of items through the drop table. This will result in the more rare shards to become MUCH more rare as the previous values were not properly respected.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
