<p>We are working as diligently as we can to address all the reported bugs. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes the issue where some affixes were not being rounded properly</li>
  <li>Adjusted max mana and max life potion affixes to much lower values</li>
  <li>Quest book font size increased slightly</li>
  <li>Adds message in-game when trying to break a Crimson/Shadow orb normally, stating that you should follow the quest line instead</li>
  <li>Adds Mana Cost to tooltip display for all weapons that use mana</li>
  <li>Fixed Morgana quest start dialogue text displaying incorrect parts required</li>
  <li>Adds “Maximum Minion Count” to character sheet display</li>
  <li>Fixes swords alt use cooldown triggering when right clicking while swinging</li>
  <li>Fixes broadswords not having the correct swing speed. Iron and Steel Broadsword were the incorrect ones</li>
  <li>Broadswords are now correctly categorized as such. Previously they were just classified as swords, but they are meant to be their own class. They just share the same alt use (for now?)</li>
  <li>Put the (BETA) tag in the mod name. Some people were expecting a fully polished mod, but in reality this is definitely a beta. We are just trying to label it better.</li>
  <li>Adds in sprites for missing skill augmentations and skill passives</li>
  <li>Boomerangs received a buff across the board.</li>
  <li>Damage values for Iron Boomerang and Copper Boomerang were swapped</li>
  <li>Whips have received a buff across the board</li>
  <li>Whips progression has been changed slightly. Whips have further spread between dropping item levels, but received large damage boosts at each progression point</li>
  <li>Added a safeguard around spawning Morven in the Corruption after killing EoC. This should result a common crash when completing EoC kill that would end up resulting in not getting EoC kill completion.</li>
  <li>Adds in several French localizations</li>
</ul>
