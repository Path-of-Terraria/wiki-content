<blockquote>
  <p>This is not yet released</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Rewrote all hardmode maps to determine their area level/level condition by using the formula instead of hardcoding. This should result in less bugs around drops in maps not respecting the correct area level</li>
  <li>Fixed Fishron Map dropping early</li>
  <li>Fix for Skeletron Prime bag now dropping and throwing exceptions in odd scenarios</li>
  <li>Stopped NPCs from dropping mech boss summons</li>
  <li>War Shields and Boomerangs now have the right item level</li>
  <li>Completed quests are now selectable to see the steps again</li>
  <li>Completed quests can't be secretly pinned anymore</li>
  <li>Fixed some mouse texts, such as that of the ruler mode and minimap hovers, not displaying.</li>
  <li>Fixed tooltips not showing for item chat tags and similar mod elements</li>
  <li>Dragged inventory items' tooltips will now also display when hovering over item chat tags.</li>
  <li>Causing bosses to despawn in one way or another will no longer count as a victory. They will instead respawn in a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Explorable maps now drop -1 to +1 of their tier. So in a tier 8 you can drop tier 7-9</li>
  <li>Fixed passives outside of the initial viewport not responding due to existing outside of the parent UI element.</li>
  <li>Fixes loot distribution in chests. Should match that of mob drops now</li>
  <li>The implementation of extra accessory slots has been moved onto TML's shoulders, resolving all the remaining accessory-slot-related issues that were still present after the last batch of fixes.</li>
  <li>Extra accessory slots added by other mods may now show up if not disallowed by Path Of Terraria's internal filtering.</li>
  <li>Fixed various changes to stats not being applied when accessories are placed in additional slots (third or fourth). Examples: Shackles' defense, Pygmy Necklace.</li>
  <li>Fixed right-click equipment logic behaving incorrectly when it came to extra accessory slots.</li>
  <li>Fixed accessory dyes sometimes applying to the wrong accessories.</li>
  <li>Players will now be able to retrieve items from extra dye and vanity slots that might have gotten 'stuck in the shadow realm' after the last batch of fixes.</li>
  <li>Fixed staff hold animations desyncing in multiplayer.</li>
  <li>Multiple rings of the same type can now be equipped at once.</li>
  <li>Potions can now not be used while at full hp or full mp</li>
  <li>Added sell price of 20silver to all grimoire items.</li>
  <li>The check for “Tier x or Higher” explorable map completion was resolved. So if your quest is on “Tier 2” maps, you can complete 3,4, etc and it will count</li>
  <li>Each tier of explorable map quest has been reduced from 10 → 5</li>
  <li>Fixes an exception that could be thrown during the Elder Grovekeeper generation</li>
</ul>
