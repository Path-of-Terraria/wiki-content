<blockquote>
  <p>This is not yet released</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Rewrote all hardmode maps to determine their area level/level condition by using the formula instead of hardcoding. This should result in less bugs around drops in maps not respecting the correct area level</li>
  <li>Fixed Fishron Map dropping early</li>
  <li>Fix for Skeletron Prime bag now dropping and throwing exceptions in odd scenarios</li>
  <li>Stopped NPCs from dropping mech boss summons</li>
  <li>War Shields and Boomerangs now have the right item level</li>
  <li>Completed quests are now selectable to see the steps again</li>
  <li>Completed quests can't be secretly pinned anymore</li>
  <li>Fixed some mouse texts, such as that of the ruler mode and minimap hovers, not displaying.</li>
  <li>Fixed tooltips not showing for item chat tags and similar mod elements</li>
  <li>Dragged inventory items' tooltips will now also display when hovering over item chat tags.</li>
  <li>Causing bosses to despawn in one way or another will no longer count as a victory. They will instead respawn in a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Explorable maps now drop -1 to +1 of their tier. So in a tier 8 you can drop tier 7-9</li>
  <li>Fixed passives outside of the initial viewport not responding due to existing outside of the parent UI element.</li>
  <li>Fixes loot distribution in chests. Should match that of mob drops now</li>
</ul>
