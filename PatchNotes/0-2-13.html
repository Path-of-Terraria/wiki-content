<ul>
  <li>Rewrote all hardmode maps to determine their area level/level condition by using the formula instead of hardcoding. This should result in less bugs around drops in maps not respecting the correct area level</li>
  <li>Fixed Fishron Map dropping early</li>
  <li>Fix for Skeletron Prime bag now dropping and throwing exceptions in odd scenarios</li>
  <li>Stopped NPCs from dropping mech boss summons</li>
</ul>
