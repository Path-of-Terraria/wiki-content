# Events
Events in Path of Terraria sometimes have a different set of criteria and ways that they spawn and those will be explicitly called out here.

### Pre-Hardmode

#### [Goblin Army](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Events/GoblinArmy)

The Goblin Army Event is changed in Path of Terraria.

Information on it [here https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Events/GoblinArmy](https://wiki.pathofterraria.com/en/Events/GoblinArmy)

#### Slime Rain
Does not spawn naturally. This is to ensure the King Slime Domain map is required to progress.

### Hardmode
#### Lunar Pillars
The Lunar Pillar event takes place inside of the Lunatic Cultist's Domain map.
