<p>There are four <strong>Class Quests</strong> in Path of Terraria, each focused on a certain class and a certain NPC in <a href="/Towns/Ravencrest">Ravencrest</a>. They are the first quests the player can do, awarding the player with a class-respective ability, a few class items, and experience.</p>
<p>At least one of these quests must be completed for <a href="/npcs/Garrick">Garrick</a> to appear, and allow further progression with the questline.</p>
