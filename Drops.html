<h3>How do item drops work in Path of Terraria?</h3>
<p>The “Main” World where you start has a global Item Level attached to it that rises as you play the game. Slaying bosses, completing maps, doing quests, all have an effect on the global item level.</p>
<p>Most of the items in Path of Terraria can be dropped as long as their minimum item level is met. Each item has their own Item Level requirement. Check the page on these items for information on their Minimum Level Required.</p>
<p>All items that are dropped will have the Item Level from the world they were dropped in.</p>
<p>Maps have their own Item Level attached and do <strong>not </strong>have the global item level assigned or added to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What about Crafting?</h3>
<p>You can craft items through the <a href="/Items/Currency">Crafting System</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Drop Chances &amp; Rates</h3>
<p>As you progress through the mod the area level will increase and so will the drop chances. Check out the table below for more info</p>
